        <hr>
        <p>To make a flower arrangement, you first have to select a flower to place.<br>
            You can do this by clicking on the flower's name in your inventory (on the left).</p>
        <p>Once you place a flower, that tile will show your flower name, and a number, like so: "Daisy (4)"<br>
            The number is the score that flower gives you from being in the arrangement.</p>
        <p>When you're satisfied with your arrangement, click "submit arrangement".<br>
            You will recieve money based on how high your arrangement score was.<br>
            In addition, every once in a while you can restock your flowers from the shop.</p>
        <p>You'll find that certain plants work better in certain places.<br>
            For example, Dusty Miller works better as a filler plant away from the center.<br>
            Some plants, like roses, work best as focal plants in the center.</p>
